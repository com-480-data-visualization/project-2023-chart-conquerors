## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

The dataset we're going to use is Friends Corpus (available [here](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/friends.html)), a collection of the scripts of the worldwide famous TV series Friends, collecting every utterance of the series.

This dataset is already very valuable to us, and won't need any data cleaning, as it's already organized in three ways:
 - Speaker-level information: we can filter the data based on a speakers' set, where speakers are characters of the series with a special speaker TRANSCRIPT_NODE for utterances not related to a speaker speaking (e.g. [Rachel stands up])
 - Utterance-level information: utterances provide various details. An id to identify them based on the season, episode, scene, and # of utterances, the speaker, the utterance that he's replying to, the id of the conversation it belongs to, and the content of the utterance.
 - Conversation-level information: as mentioned at the link above, 'Conversations represent scenes of the show. They are indexed by the id sXX-eYY-cZZ, where XX denotes the season (e.g. 01), YY denotes the episode (e.g. 01), ZZ denotes the conversation (e.g. 01)'

The only cases in which we’ll need to do some data cleaning will be when using TRANSCRIPT_NODE or emotions, as not all the lines are provided with information about this, so we’ll be forced to do some filtering to use only the lines having this information.

### Problematic

#### Overview
In this data visualization project, we aim to analyze and display the conversational patterns and emotional expressions of the characters in the popular American sitcom "Friends," which aired for ten seasons in the 1990s. The dataset we are working with contains 236 episodes, 3,107 scenes (conversations), 67,373 utterances, and 700 characters (users). By visualizing this data, we hope to gain insights into the dynamics of the show's interactions, character relationships, and emotional expressions.

#### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore the conversations in a widely popular TV show and understand the factors that made it engaging for millions of viewers. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we can uncover patterns and trends in the characters' interactions and emotions, providing a unique perspective on the show's storytelling and character development.

#### Target Audience
Our target audience includes fans of the TV show "Friends," data visualization enthusiasts, and media scholars interested in understanding the conversational dynamics and emotions of a popular TV series. This project will be valuable to those who want to explore the nuances of character interactions in a television series in an engaging and accessible manner.

#### Main Axes
- **Conversational dynamics**: We will analyze and visualize the conversational patterns among the characters, including the frequency and length of conversations, the distribution of conversations across seasons, and the characters' participation in dialogues.
- **Emotional expressions**: By studying the emotional expressions in the conversations, we will visualize the emotional arcs of the characters throughout the series and identify patterns in the emotions displayed by different characters.
- **Character relationships**: We will explore the relationships between the characters by examining their interactions and the emotional expressions exchanged. This will help us identify the key relationships in the show and how they evolve over time.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

We import everything and plot a first visual sketch of the values of our dataset. Everything is available in the  [jupyter notebook](milestone1.ipynb).

### Related work

Given the popularity of the show, there are plenty of available datasets regarding the show’s transcripts. Here’s a list of the relevant works we have found (note that none use the exact dataset that will be used in the project, but similar variations):
- **Analysis of the different season’s transcripts**
  - Goal of the analysis: find who the main character of the show is by inspecting metrics on lines and appearances in the different episodes.
  - Results and statistical analysis available [here](https://yashuseth.wordpress.com/2017/12/29/data-analysis-lead-character-of-friends-data-science/)
- **General purpose data visualization using a Friends dataset**
  - Goal of the analysis: explore and analyze the transcript data for personal interest, and as a challenge activity.
  - Results and visualization available [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/data-visualization-with-friends-426ebc733886)
- **Data analysis using a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Model**
  - Goal of the analysis: explore the emotional element of the character’s lines and profile their overall personality using an AI model, IBM’s Watson suite for the automated classification of each line.
  - Results and visualization available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-of-the-lead-characters-on-f-r-i-e-n-d-s-51aa5abf1fa6)

All of these projects differ from our intended approach in that they use standard, objective metrics to deduce a conclusion (e.g.: who speaks more, who appears more on screen, etc.) or do not include native data relating to character emotions, which is generated with some form of post-processing.

#### Previous work on the dataset
No group member(s) have previously worked with this dataset, or similarly themed previously.

#### Inspiration
Our main source of inspiration is the one about the [Beatles’ music over the years](https://duelingdata.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-beatles.html), the theming of the lyrics and their success depending on the keyword of the songs, as written by the different members. We especially want to develop a visualization that, as this one, enables filtering the data according to each character, and their profiling based on their lines and interactions with the other characters.

### Visualizations descriptions

#### -**Viz 1: Network Graph**:
This visualization will represent how characters interact with each other. We want to display which characters talk more with which characters, which characters like to gossip and who do they like to gossip about, what words and phrases are used when talking about a certain character, and what are the words and phrases more associated between the characters. Here is a sketch of how we would like the visualization to be:

![Screenshot 2023-05-06 191831](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71851119/236638174-7522c431-05b0-4496-861c-1b6775b3aa30.png)

Here we can see the main characters, and the most important second characters. The color of each edge would represent the number of interactions or gossips between each character, the darker the color is, the more interactions between those 2 characters there are. It will also be possible to click on the nodes and edges. 

![Screenshot 2023-05-06 193215](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71851119/236638716-95e3aa2e-93c7-4274-9716-5a2f8b679f82.png)

We can see that when a node is cliked, we will give general information about that user, such as the name, maybe a description if it's a secondary character for people who are not familiar with the TV show, in this example Janice would be "Chandler's ex-girlfriend", we also want to display what character does she like to interact more with or gossip more about, and words and phrases that are used specially by that character.

![Screenshot 2023-05-06 194012](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71851119/236638982-938cf926-62e0-46f6-acbb-51cd9fe3c9d9.png)

And when clicking an edge we want to give information related specifically about those two characters, what topics do they talk about, what sentences and words do they exchange usually between them. With this plot we aim to give an interactive and insightful experience to users to understand and explore more about the different relationships about the characters.

Finally, the list of course materials relating to this visualization which have been and will be useful in the development of this visualization are:
- Mark and channels
  — Visual attributes, shapes, sizes, saturation, perception, separability
- Perception and color
  — Visual popup, boundary detection, proximity, similarity
- Interactions
  — Transitions, attribute reduction, linked views, partitioning
- Graphs


#### -**Viz 2: Pie chart scatterplot**:
The goal of this visualization is to show the emotional split in the main characters' dialogue. Each character will be displayed as a pie chart highlighting the different emotions and their proportion over their whole dialogue, the user being able to hover over each sector to uncover additional information. Aside from them will be a legend providing the color coding used as well as some additional information relating to the data being displayed. Clicking on legend items will enable filtering the sectors by the different emotions and observing which of these characters show more or less of it. The emotional data is taken from individual dialogue lines from the different episodes, so the piecharts will be placed along a horizontal axis enabling selecting a range of seasons. Vertically, the piecharts will be sorted with variable height depending on number of lines spoken in that period. This information can be displayed upon clicking or hovering each character's image, centered in the pie chart. These skteched show the initial concept design for this visualization.

The following prototypes show a more detailed view of a possible look and behavior of the final visualization. Some of the more cosmetic aspects (including hover actions changed for static displays in suitable positions) could be modified without sacrficing the experience and meaning of the visualization.

#### -**Viz 3: Bar charts and scatterplots**:
The idea for this visualization is to show the link between a character appearances, number of lines and numbers of words to provide insights on how this are related between each other. The bar chart will display the number of appearances of each character. Aligned with it, right below it, there will be two scatterplots initially empty that will display the number of lines on each appearance and the number of words on each line of the character we're hovering or clicking in the bar chart. Also, a bar chart with the character's favourite words will be displayed, displaying for each word their number of occurences sorted from most to less used. This sketch shows the initial state of the visualization:

On hover or click, the scatterplots and words' barchart will show the data as follows:
