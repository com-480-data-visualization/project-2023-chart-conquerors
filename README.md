## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

#### Overview
In this data visualization project, we aim to analyze and display the conversational patterns and emotional expressions of the characters in the popular American sitcom "Friends," which aired for ten seasons in the 1990s. The dataset we are working with contains 236 episodes, 3,107 scenes (conversations), 67,373 utterances, and 700 characters (users). By visualizing this data, we hope to gain insights into the dynamics of the show's interactions, character relationships, and emotional expressions.

#### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore the conversations in a widely popular TV show and understand the factors that made it engaging for millions of viewers. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we can uncover patterns and trends in the characters' interactions and emotions, providing a unique perspective on the show's storytelling and character development.

#### Target Audience
Our target audience includes fans of the TV show "Friends," data visualization enthusiasts, and media scholars interested in understanding the conversational dynamics and emotions of a popular TV series. This project will be valuable to those who want to explore the nuances of character interactions in a television series in an engaging and accessible manner.

#### Main Axes
- **Conversational dynamics**: We will analyze and visualize the conversational patterns among the characters, including the frequency and length of conversations, the distribution of conversations across seasons, and the characters' participation in dialogues.
- **Emotional expressions**: By studying the emotional expressions in the conversations, we will visualize the emotional arcs of the characters throughout the series and identify patterns in the emotions displayed by different characters.
- **Character relationships**: We will explore the relationships between the characters by examining their interactions and the emotional expressions exchanged. This will help us identify the key relationships in the show and how they evolve over time.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
